Add a field to your table called in_print. This should be a boolean field.

What should you do to see your changes reflected in your database table? You'll have to makemigrations and migrate again. Once you do, a prompt will walk you through filling in values for the existing entries. Why is this? Discuss with your cohort-mates. Ask an instructor if you and your friends can't work it out.
